/*q1
	Java Does not support default arguments by default. Explain how to use method overloading techniques to create default arguments indirectly.
	ANSWER : there are several ways to create default arguments in Java, but method overloading is the cleanest and simplest. We can use 
			default parameters in method overloading by giving them different data types or by having different number of parameters. But
			the limitation in this method is that you can't have two optional parameters of same data type and any of them can't be excluded. */
